# A Deep Learning-assisted Template Attack Against Dynamic Frequency Scaling Countermeasures

To run an experiment, follow the Jupyter Notebook `DLaTA.ipynb`.

## Organization

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/CNN`: Contains modules and configuration files for the Convolutional Neural Network use for classify the operating frequency.
- `/templateAttack`: Contains functions and classes for profiling a Template Attack and attacking side-channel traces.
- `/utils`: Contains functions for segmenting and interpolating side-channel traces.
- `DLaTA`: Jupyter Notebook for running a demo.

## Dataset

The `DFS_DESYNCH` dataset is avaible [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hardware-fab/DFS_DESYNCH) on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face.

The dataset is stored in the HDF5 file format (`dfs_desynch.h5`) and has the following structure:

- **Profiling and Attack groups:** The traces are separated into two main groups: "profiling" and "attack". Each group contains 128,000 traces for a total of 256,000 traces.
- **Three Datasets per group:** Each group ("profiling" and "attack") consists of three internal datasets:
  - **traces:** This dataset includes 128,000 power traces, each containing 200,000 time samples. The traces capture the entire AES encryption process preceded by a sequence of random instructions. The traces are pre-processed with a high-pass filter with a 125 kHz cut-off frequency.
  - **labels:** This dataset provides labels for each power trace in the "traces" dataset, indicating the frequency changes that occurred during the measurement. Each label has two fields:
    - `sample`: This field denotes the time sample at which a frequency change happens, with values ranging from 0 to 200,000.
    - `frequency`: This field specifies the new operating frequency starting from the corresponding sample. It can take values from the set {35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60}.
  - **metadata:** This dataset contains metadata for each trace, including two members:
    - `key`: The secret key used for AES encryption.
    - `plaintext`: The plaintext used for the AES encryption.
  
### How to Download

1. Download DFS_DESYNCH dataset from ðŸ¤— [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hardware-fab/DFS_DESYNCH).

    ```python
    from datasets import load_dataset

    dataset = load_dataset("hardware-fab/DFS_DESYNCH")
    ```

2. Assemble dataset chunks in one (virtual) dataset file.

    ```bash
    python assemble.py --dataset_dir <download_path>
    ```

    Replace `<download_path>` with the actual download path.
    The `assemble.py` script is available along with the dataset.
